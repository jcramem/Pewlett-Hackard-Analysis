# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to prepare for the upcoming surge in eligible retirees by determining the number of retiring employees per title and identifying employees who may participate in the mentorship program. 

## Resources
* Data Sources: employees.csv, dept_emp.csv, titles.csv
* Software: PostgreSQL 11.1, pgAdmin 4

## Results 
The following represent major findings from our personnel analysis:

* The company will be hit hardest by the loss of experienced staff, as nearly two-thirds of potential retirees (64%) are senior staff or senior engineers.
* The group of potential retirees is split evenly between engineers and other staff (i.e., 50% in each group), meaning the company will likely need to address deficiencies across the entire company.
