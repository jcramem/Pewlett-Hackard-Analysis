# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to prepare for the upcoming surge in eligible retirees by determining the number of retiring employees per title and identifying employees who may participate in the mentorship program. 

## Resources
* Data Sources: employees.csv, dept_emp.csv, titles.csv
* Software: PostgreSQL 11.1, pgAdmin 4

## Results 
The following represent major findings from our personnel analysis:

* The company will be hit hardest by the loss of experienced staff, as nearly two-thirds of potential retirees (64%) are senior staff or senior engineers.
* The group of potential retirees is split evenly between engineers and other staff (i.e., 50% in each group); the company will likely need to address deficiencies across the entire company.
* Employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program, roughly half are engineers (48%) roughly half are other staff (52%). Mentorships should be available in each department.  
* The majority of staff eligible to participate in the mentorship program (64%) are senior staff; the company should have ample staff with experience to mentor new employees.

## Summary
In sum, the company should have sufficient staff in key areas to address some of problems that may arise with a large number of employees retiring. Further analysis specific to (a) managerial and (b) departmental positions and leadership could enhance potential adjustments.
